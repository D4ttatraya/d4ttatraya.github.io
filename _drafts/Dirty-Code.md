title: Advantages(!) of Dirty Code
---

First and foremost advantage for me is that I don't need to define it; ðŸ˜Š! Almost everyone, who have written any kind of program, knows what dirty code is; whether or not everyone realizes it is another story.

Internet is flooded with principles, rules, techniques, best practices, how-to steps to write code. And now-a-days almost every programmer is also talking about some kind of techniques to follow while writing code in respective programming languages. While using such techniques in writing code we have to follow lots of rules and best practices. Ultimately it puts many constraints to write code freely, slows us down, makes us fail to achieve time-lines of deliveries, and much more pain than any programmer can imagine.

Here is high-level summary of pains we can have if decided to follow such practices:  
- Takes lot of time to name things  
- Needs unnecessary separation between modules  
- Makes us write lot of extra code which never will be in product builds  
- Not allowing to add comments  
- Makes us sit in pairs with peers/colleagues  
- Force to make intentional errors first and then solve them


## Naming Things

## De-coupling of Modules

## Unit Tests

## Readability
No need of comments

## Pair Programming

## TDD

Why should we think of the above things and why should we worry about:
- Easy to read, understand  
- Easy to replace modules, alogs  
- Easy to debug and fix bugs  
- Easy to modify  
- Easy to reuse  
- Easy to add new features
