  Video technology involves, as per the most common definition, recording and playing back moving pictures and sound. It has grown from manually rotating series of sketches around the wheel to modern digital video players with 60fps frame rate, 8K resolution playback, and lot more capabilities.<br>
  Out of many fields where video technology is being used, there is one prominent field where video technology shines the most is <b>Streaming Videos</b>. And this is what I'm going to dig deep and write about in this series of posts.
  Also, as an iOS Developer, I'm going to be more focused on <b>HLS</b> and using it on Apple platforms.
