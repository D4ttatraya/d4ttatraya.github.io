title: Using Online Markdown Editor to Write Blogs on GitHub Pages/Sites
---

I was very exited to write blogs about my experiences, about new things that I learned recently, summaries of my tech-social findings I explored. I was googling about free blog writing services available today and I didnâ€™t found any difficulty to reach [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). I found it very easy and very simple to write and publish our content online without worrying about maintenance and security.

This is my first ever blog I am writing, more or less this is not a blog but rules I need to follow while writing actual blogs in future. These rules are not ethics or disciplines, but are technical rules of GitHub online markdown editor to beautify our content. Beautify may not be the right word but I think highlighting, formatting, inserting code snippets, showing media is one kind of beautification for technical content writing.

As GitHub Pages supports [Jekyll- Static Site Generator in Ruby](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/) we can also use Jekyll editor and write or blogs. But as I wanted to write my blogs with very simple formatting and without involving complex editors and programming languages I choose to go with GitHub online markdown editor.

GitHub's online markdown editor is sufficient to write simply formatted blogs. Once we done writing blog content in this editor, after saving changes to GitHub our blog goes live automatically. While in this process GitHub Pages makes some changes in our markdown as we can see some differences in GitHub and live blog as:

On GitHub-  
![name]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Rules-Blog/H1-Github.png)  

On Live Page-  
![name]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Rules-Blog/H1-Live.png)


So here is markdown cheetsheet and how it reflect in our live blog:
1 Headings
We can also use # symbol to add headings as:
#- H1
GitHub shows this tag as H1 header with underline-ish style. But on live blog it eliminates the underline-ish style.

2 Word Processing:
Bold- To mark any text as bold just put ** from both sides of the text.
Italic-
